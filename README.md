# Sandboxed Form Element for Angular

This project is a simple Angular showcase application that demonstrates how easiy it is to integrate the [`component-sandbox` library](https://github.com/alexander-heimbuch/component-sandbox) into an Angular application.

The following 3rd party libraries are used to create the simple user interface:

1. [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
2. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
3. [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/)
2. [flatpickr](https://flatpickr.js.org/)

## Run showcase app

Run `ng serve` (or `npm run start`) for a dev server. Navigate to [`localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
